# TLOPO-Sword-DPS-Dashboard
Python and exe files for creating a dashboard to anaylze damage per second on varies swords in TLOPO

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. If you're on windows, you can download the entire exe folder which contains an .exe file to easily run the dashboard. This is located in the "dist" folder, but it has dependencies on the whole folder so download it all. When run, it opens a console window and a new tab on a browser with a local host url to a local dash app server run by the executable file. When you're done, just close the tab and close the console to end the server.
2. If you have python setup on your computer you can run the python file instead with the same outcomes.
3. There is also a jupyter lab notebook that can be run producing a dashboard app within jupyter lab.

# TLOPO-Sword-DPS-Dashboard
Python and exe files for creating a dashboard to anaylze damage per second on varies swords in TLOPO

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. If you're on windows (and maybe mac and other systems), you can download the exe file which will easily run the dashboard. When run, it opens a console window and a new tab on a browser to a dash app server run locally by you through the executable file. When you're done, just close the tab and close the console to end the server.
2. If you have python setup on your computer you can run the python file instead with the same outcomes, though you may need to install some packages first.
3. There is also a jupyter lab notebook that can be run producing a dashboard app within jupyter lab.
